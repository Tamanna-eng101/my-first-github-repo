        The key difference between "like" and "love" lies in the intensity and depth of feeling.
        Liking someone is a positive sentiment, enjoying their company and finding them pleasant.
        Love, on the other hand, involves a deeper emotional connection, characterized by strong feelings of affection, care, and commitment.
        While you might like many people, love is typically reserved for a select few, often involving a profound sense of attachment.
